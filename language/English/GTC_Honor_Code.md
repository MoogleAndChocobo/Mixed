# GTC Honor COde

1. I will translate the best of my ability and not intentionally provide bad translations.
2. I will not submit machine-translated text.
3. I will read the Overview Page and follow my language coordinators' instructions for getting started.
4. I will not enter my name as part of the translations, as this will corrpute the Translation Memory and unfairly discredit others' hard work.
5. I will not dissenminate any course material I gain access to as a GTC volunteer.
6. I will do my best to follow the GTC's standard traslation guidelines.
7. I will treat my fellow translators with kindness and respect; I will not delete other people's translations.
